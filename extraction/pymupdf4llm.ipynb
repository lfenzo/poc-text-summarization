      "**General Description**\n",
      "The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to\n",
      "12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an\n",
      "alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper\n",
      "and lower trigger points. The DS18B20 communicates\n",
      "over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one\n",
      "data line (and ground) for communication with a central\n",
      "microprocessor. In addition, the DS18B20 can derive\n",
      "power directly from the data line (“parasite power”),\n",
      "eliminating the need for an external power supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which\n",
      "allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire\n",

      "control many DS18B20s distributed over a large area.\n",
      "Applications that can benefit from this feature include\n",

In addition, the scratchpad provides access to the\\n1-byte upper and lower alarm trigger registers (TH and\\nTL) and the 1-byte configuration register. The configuration register allows the user to set the resolution of the\\ntemperature-to-digital conversion to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits.\\nThe TH, TL, and configuration registers are nonvolatile\\n(EEPROM), so they will retain data when the device is\\npowered down.\\n\\nThe DS18B20 uses Maxim’s exclusive 1-Wire bus protocol that implements bus communication using one control\\nsignal. The control line requires a weak pullup resistor\\nsince all devices are linked to the bus via a 3-state or\\nopen-drain port (the DQ pin in the case of the DS18B20).\\nIn this bus system, the microprocessor (the master\\ndevice) identifies and addresses devices on the bus\\nusing each device’s unique 64-bit code. Because each\\ndevice has a unique code, the number of devices that\\ncan be addressed on one bus is virtually unlimited. The\\n1-Wire bus protocol, including detailed explanations of the\\ncommands and “time slots,” is covered in the 1-Wire Bus\\n_System section._\\n\\nAnother feature of the DS18B20 is the ability to operate without an external power supply.

This method of\\nderiving power from the 1-Wire bus is referred to as “parasite power.” As an alternative, the DS18B20 may also be\\npowered by an external supply on VDD.\\n\\n**Operation—Measuring Temperature**\\nThe core functionality of the DS18B20 is its direct-todigital temperature sensor. The resolution of the temperature sensor is user-configurable to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits,\\ncorresponding to increments of 0.5°C, 0.25°C, 0.125°C,\\nand 0.0625°C, respectively. The default resolution at\\npower-up is 12-bit. The DS18B20 powers up in a lowpower idle state. To initiate a temperature measurement\\nand A-to-D conversion, the master must issue a Convert\\nT [44h] command. Following the conversion, the resulting\\nthermal data is stored in the 2-byte temperature register\\nin the scratchpad memory and the DS18B20 returns to its\\nidle state. If the DS18B20 is powered by an external supply, the master can issue “read time slots” (see the 1-Wire\\n_Bus System_ section) after the Convert T command and\\nthe DS18B20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the temperature conversion is in progress and 1 when the conversion is done. If the DS18B20 is powered with parasite\\npower, this notification technique cannot be used since\\nthe bus must be pulled high by a strong pullup during the\\nentire temperature conversion.

Any DS18B20s with a set alarm flag will\\nrespond to the command, so the master can determine\\nexactly which DS18B20s have experienced an alarm\\ncondition. If an alarm condition exists and the TH or TL\\nsettings have changed, another temperature conversion\\nshould be done to validate the alarm condition.\\n\\n**Powering the DS18B20**\\nThe DS18B20 can be powered by an external supply on\\nthe VDD pin, or it can operate in “parasite power” mode,\\nwhich allows the DS18B20 to function without a local\\nexternal supply. Parasite power is very useful for applications that require remote temperature sensing or that are\\nvery space constrained. Figure 3 shows the DS18B20’s\\nparasite-power control circuitry, which “steals” power from\\nthe 1-Wire bus via the DQ pin when the bus is high. The\\nstolen charge powers the DS18B20 while the bus is high,\\nand some of the charge is stored on the parasite power\\ncapacitor (CPP) to provide power when the bus is low.\\nWhen the DS18B20 is used in parasite power mode, the\\nVDD pin must be connected to ground.\\n\\nIn parasite power mode, the 1-Wire bus and CPP can provide sufficient current to the DS18B20 for most operations\\nas long as the specified timing and voltage requirements\\nare met (see the _DC Electrical Characteristics and_ _AC_\\n_Electrical Characteristics). However, when the DS18B20_\\nis performing temperature conversions or copying data\\nfrom the scratchpad memory to EEPROM, the operating\\ncurrent can be as high as 1.5mA. This current can cause\\nan unacceptable voltage drop across the weak 1-Wire\\npullup resistor and is more current than can be supplied\\n\\n\\nby CPP. To assure that the DS18B20 has sufficient supply\\ncurrent, it is necessary to provide a strong pullup on the\\n1-Wire bus whenever temperature conversions are taking place or data is being copied from the scratchpad to\\nEEPROM. This can be accomplished by using a MOSFET\\nto pull the bus directly to the rail as shown in Figure 6. The\\n1-Wire bus must be switched to the strong pullup within\\n10µs (max) after a Convert T [44h] or Copy Scratchpad\\n\\n[48h] command is issued, and the bus must be held high\\nby the pullup for the duration of the conversion (tCONV)\\nor data transfer (tWR = 10ms). No other activity can take\\nplace on the 1-Wire bus while the pullup is enabled.\\n\\nThe DS18B20 can also be powered by the conventional\\nmethod of connecting an external power supply to the\\nVDD pin, as shown in Figure 7. The advantage of this\\nmethod is that the MOSFET pullup is not required, and\\nthe 1-Wire bus is free to carry other traffic during the temperature conversion time.\\n\\nThe use of parasite power is not recommended for temperatures above +100°C since the DS18B20 may not be\\nable to sustain communications due to the higher leakage currents that can exist at these temperatures. For\\napplications in which such temperatures are likely, it is\\nstrongly recommended that the DS18B20 be powered by\\nan external power supply.\\n\\nIn some situations the bus master may not know whether\\nthe DS18B20s on the bus are parasite powered or powered by external supplies. The master needs this information to determine if the strong bus pullup should be used\\nduring temperature conversions. To get this information,\\nthe master can issue a Skip ROM [CCh] command followed by a Read Power Supply [B4h] command followed\\nby a “read time slot”. During the read time slot, parasite\\npowered DS18B20s will pull the bus low, and externally\\npowered DS18B20s will let the bus remain high. If the\\nbus is pulled low, the master knows that it must supply\\nthe strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus during temperature\\nconversions.\\n\\n|Col1|Col2|\\n|---|---|\\n\\n\\nVPU\\n\\n**DS18B20**\\n\\nVPU\\n\\nGND DQ VDD\\n\\nµP\\n\\n4.7kΩ\\n\\n1-Wire BUS TO OTHER\\n\\n1-Wire DEVICES\\n\\n\\n**DS18B20**\\n\\nVPU VDD (EXTERNAL\\n\\nGND DQ VDD SUPPLY)\\n\\nµP\\n\\n4.7kΩ\\n\\n1-Wire BUS TO OTHER\\n\\n1-Wire DEVICES\\n\\n\\n_Figure 6.

The scratchpad CRC is calculated from\\nthe data stored in the scratchpad, and therefore it changes when the data in the scratchpad changes. The CRCs\\nprovide the bus master with a method of data validation\\nwhen data is read from the DS18B20. To verify that data\\nhas been read correctly, the bus master must re-calculate\\nthe CRC from the received data and then compare this\\nvalue to either the ROM code CRC (for ROM reads) or\\nto the scratchpad CRC (for scratchpad reads).

There is no circuitry inside the\\nDS18B20 that prevents a command sequence from proceeding if the DS18B20 CRC (ROM or scratchpad) does\\nnot match the value generated by the bus master.\\n\\nThe equivalent polynomial function of the CRC (ROM or\\nscratchpad) is:\\n\\nCRC = X[8] + X[5] + X[4 ]+ 1\\n\\nThe bus master can re-calculate the CRC and compare it\\nto the CRC values from the DS18B20 using the polynomial generator shown in Figure 11. This circuit consists\\nof a shift register and XOR gates, and the shift register\\nbits are initialized to 0. Starting with the least significant\\nbit of the ROM code or the least significant bit of byte 0\\nin the scratchpad, one bit at a time should shifted into the\\nshift register. After shifting in the 56th bit from the ROM or\\nthe most significant bit of byte 7 from the scratchpad, the\\npolynomial generator will contain the recalculated CRC.\\nNext, the 8-bit ROM code or scratchpad CRC from the\\nDS18B20 must be shifted into the circuit. At this point, if\\nthe re-calculated CRC was correct, the shift register will\\ncontain all 0s.

The DS18B20 is always a\\nslave. When there is only one slave on the bus, the system is referred to as a “single-drop” system; the system is\\n“multidrop” if there are multiple slaves on the bus.\\n\\nAll data and commands are transmitted least significant\\nbit first over the 1-Wire bus.\\n\\nThe following discussion of the 1-Wire bus system is\\nbroken down into three topics: hardware configuration,\\ntransaction sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types\\nand timing).\\n\\n**Hardware Configuration**\\nThe 1-Wire bus has by definition only a single data line.\\nEach device (master or slave) interfaces to the data line\\nvia an open-drain or 3-state port. This allows each device\\nto “release” the data line when the device is not transmitting data so the bus is available for use by another device.\\nThe 1-Wire port of the DS18B20 (the DQ pin) is open\\ndrain with an internal circuit equivalent to that shown in\\nFigure 12.\\n\\nThe 1-Wire bus requires an external pullup resistor of\\napproximately 5kΩ; thus, the idle state for the 1-Wire\\nbus is high. If for any reason a transaction needs to be\\nsuspended, the bus MUST be left in the idle state if the\\ntransaction is to resume. Infinite recovery time can occur\\nbetween bits so long as the 1-Wire bus is in the inactive\\n(high) state during the recovery period. If the bus is held\\nlow for more than 480µs, all components on the bus will\\nbe reset.\\n\\nVPU\\n\\n**DS18B20**\\n4.7kΩ **1-WIRE PORT**\\n\\nRx 1-WIRE BUS DQ Rx\\n\\n5µA Tx\\nTYP\\n\\n100Ω\\nMOSFET\\n\\nTx\\n\\nRx = RECEIVE\\nTx = TRANSMIT\\n\\n\\n_Figure 12. Hardware Configuration_\\n\\n\\n**Transaction Sequence**\\nThe transaction sequence for accessing the DS18B20 is\\nas follows:\\n\\nStep 1. Initialization\\n\\nStep 2. ROM Command (followed by any required data\\nexchange)\\n\\nStep 3. DS18B20 Function Command (followed by any\\nrequired data exchange)\\n\\nIt is very important to follow this sequence every time the\\nDS18B20 is accessed, as the DS18B20 will not respond\\nif any steps in the sequence are missing or out of order.\\nExceptions to this rule are the Search ROM [F0h] and\\nAlarm Search [ECh] commands. After issuing either of\\nthese ROM commands, the master must return to Step 1\\nin the sequence.\\n\\n**Initialization**\\nAll transactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initialization sequence. The initialization sequence consists of a\\nreset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by\\npresence pulse(s) transmitted by the slave(s). The presence pulse lets the bus master know that slave devices\\n(such as the DS18B20) are on the bus and are ready\\nto operate. Timing for the reset and presence pulses is\\ndetailed in the 1-Wire Signaling section.\\n\\n**ROM Commands**\\nAfter the bus master has detected a presence pulse, it\\ncan issue a ROM command. These commands operate\\non the unique 64-bit ROM codes of each slave device\\nand allow the master to single out a specific device if\\nmany are present on the 1-Wire bus. These commands\\nalso allow the master to determine how many and what\\ntypes of devices are present on the bus or if any device\\nhas experienced an alarm condition. There are five ROM\\ncommands, and each command is 8 bits long. The master\\ndevice must issue an appropriate ROM command before\\nissuing a DS18B20 function command. A flowchart for\\noperation of the ROM commands is shown in Figure 13.\\n\\n**Search Rom [F0h]**\\nWhen a system is initially powered up, the master must\\nidentify the ROM codes of all slave devices on the bus,\\nwhich allows the master to determine the number of\\nslaves and their device types. The master learns the\\nROM codes through a process of elimination that requires\\nthe master to perform a Search ROM cycle (i.e., Search\\nROM command followed by data exchange) as many\\ntimes as necessary to identify all of the slave devices.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For a detailed explanation of the Search\\nROM procedure, refer to _[Application Note 937: Book of](http://www.Application Note 937)_\\n_[iButton[®] Standards. After every Search ROM cycle, the](http://www.Application Note 937)_\\nbus master must return to Step 1 (Initialization) in the\\ntransaction sequence.\\n\\n**Read Rom [33h]**\\nThis command can only be used when there is one slave\\non the bus. It allows the bus master to read the slave’s\\n64-bit ROM code without using the Search ROM procedure. If this command is used when there is more than\\none slave present on the bus, a data collision will occur\\nwhen all the slaves attempt to respond at the same time.\\n\\n**Match Rom [55H]**\\nThe match ROM command followed by a 64-bit ROM\\ncode sequence allows the bus master to address a\\nspecific slave device on a multidrop or single-drop bus.\\nOnly the slave that exactly matches the 64-bit ROM code\\nsequence will respond to the function command issued\\nby the master; all other slaves on the bus will wait for a\\nreset pulse.\\n\\n**Skip Rom [CCh]**\\nThe master can use this command to address all devices\\non the bus simultaneously without sending out any ROM\\ncode information. For example, the master can make all\\nDS18B20s on the bus perform simultaneous temperature\\nconversions by issuing a Skip ROM command followed by\\na Convert T [44h] command.\\n\\nNote that the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command can\\nfollow the Skip ROM command only if there is a single\\nslave device on the bus. In this case, time is saved by\\nallowing the master to read from the slave without sending the device’s 64-bit ROM code. A Skip ROM command\\nfollowed by a Read Scratchpad command will cause\\na data collision on the bus if there is more than one\\nslave since multiple devices will attempt to transmit data\\nsimultaneously.\\n\\n**Alarm Search [ECh]**\\nThe operation of this command is identical to the operation\\nof the Search ROM command except that only slaves with\\na set alarm flag will respond. This command allows the\\nmaster device to determine if any DS18B20s experienced\\nan alarm condition during the most recent temperature\\nconversion. After every Alarm Search cycle (i.e., Alarm\\nSearch command followed by data exchange), the bus\\n\\n_iButton is a registered trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc._\\n\\n\\nmaster must return to Step 1 (Initialization) in the transaction sequence. See the Operation—Alarm Signaling section for an explanation of alarm flag operation.\\n\\n**DS18B20 Function Commands**\\nAfter the bus master has used a ROM command to\\naddress the DS18B20 with which it wishes to communicate, the master can issue one of the DS18B20 function\\ncommands. These commands allow the master to write\\nto and read from the DS18B20’s scratchpad memory,\\ninitiate temperature conversions and determine the power\\nsupply mode. The DS18B20 function commands, which\\nare described below, are summarized in Table 3 and illustrated by the flowchart in Figure 14.\\n\\n**Convert T [44h]**\\nThis command initiates a single temperature conversion.\\nFollowing the conversion, the resulting thermal data is\\nstored in the 2-byte temperature register in the scratchpad memory and the DS18B20 returns to its low-power\\nidle state. If the device is being used in parasite power\\nmode, within 10µs (max) after this command is issued\\nthe master must enable a strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus\\nfor the duration of the conversion (tCONV) as described\\nin the Powering the DS18B20 section. If the DS18B20 is\\npowered by an external supply, the master can issue read\\ntime slots after the Convert T command and the DS18B20\\nwill respond by transmitting a 0 while the temperature\\nconversion is in progress and a 1 when the conversion is\\ndone. In parasite power mode this notification technique\\ncannot be used since the bus is pulled high by the strong\\npullup during the conversion.\\n\\n**Write Scratchpad [4Eh]**\\nThis command allows the master to write 3 bytes of data\\nto the DS18B20’s scratchpad. The first data byte is written\\ninto the TH register (byte 2 of the scratchpad), the second\\nbyte is written into the TL register (byte 3), and the third\\nbyte is written into the configuration register (byte 4). Data\\nmust be transmitted least significant bit first. All three\\nbytes MUST be written before the master issues a reset,\\nor the data may be corrupted.\\n\\n**Read Scratchpad [BEh]**\\nThis command allows the master to read the contents of\\nthe scratchpad. The data transfer starts with the least significant bit of byte 0 and continues through the scratchpad\\nuntil the 9th byte (byte 8 – CRC) is read. The master may\\nissue a reset to terminate reading at any time if only part\\nof the scratchpad data is needed.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Several signal types are\\ndefined by this protocol: reset pulse, presence pulse, write\\n0, write 1, read 0, and read 1. The bus master initiates all\\nthese signals, with the exception of the presence pulse.\\n\\n**Initialization Procedure—Reset And**\\n**Presence Pulses**\\nAll communication with the DS18B20 begins with an initialization sequence that consists of a reset pulse from the\\nmaster followed by a presence pulse from the DS18B20.\\nThis is illustrated in Figure 15. When the DS18B20 sends\\nthe presence pulse in response to the reset, it is indicating\\nto the master that it is on the bus and ready to operate.\\n\\nDuring the initialization sequence the bus master transmits (TX) the reset pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low\\nfor a minimum of 480µs. The bus master then releases\\nthe bus and goes into receive mode (RX). When the bus\\nis released, the 5kΩ pullup resistor pulls the 1-Wire bus\\nhigh. When the DS18B20 detects this rising edge, it waits\\n15µs to 60µs and then transmits a presence pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low for 60µs to 240µs.\\n\\nMASTER Tx RESET PULSE MASTER Rx\\n480µs MINIMUM 480µs MINIMUM\\n\\nDS18B20\\n\\nDS18B20 TX PRESENCE\\n\\nWAITS 15-60µs\\n\\nPULSE 60-240µS\\n\\nVPU\\n\\n1-Wire BUS\\n\\nGND\\n\\nLINE TYPE LEGEND\\n\\nBUS MASTER PULLING LOW\\n\\nDS18B20 PULLING LOW\\n\\nRESISTOR PULLUP\\n\\n\\n_Figure 15. Initialization Timing_\\n\\n\\n**Read/Write Time Slots**\\nThe bus master writes data to the DS18B20 during write\\ntime slots and reads data from the DS18B20 during read\\ntime slots. One bit of data is transmitted over the 1-Wire\\nbus per time slot.\\n\\n**Write Time Slots**\\nThere are two types of write time slots: “Write 1” time slots\\nand “Write 0” time slots. The bus master uses a Write 1\\ntime slot to write a logic 1 to the DS18B20 and a Write\\n0 time slot to write a logic 0 to the DS18B20. All write\\ntime slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration with a\\nminimum of a 1µs recovery time between individual write\\nslots. Both types of write time slots are initiated by the\\nmaster pulling the 1-Wire bus low (see Figure 14).\\n\\nTo generate a Write 1 time slot, after pulling the 1-Wire\\nbus low, the bus master must release the 1-Wire bus\\nwithin 15µs. When the bus is released, the 5kΩ pullup\\nresistor will pull the bus high. To generate a Write 0 time\\nslot, after pulling the 1-Wire bus low, the bus master must\\ncontinue to hold the bus low for the duration of the time\\nslot (at least 60µs).\\n\\nThe DS18B20 samples the 1-Wire bus during a window\\nthat lasts from 15µs to 60µs after the master initiates the\\nwrite time slot. If the bus is high during the sampling window, a 1 is written to the DS18B20. If the line is low, a 0\\nis written to the DS18B20.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Read/Write Time Slot Timing Diagram_\\n\\n\\n**Read Time Slots**\\nThe DS18B20 can only transmit data to the master when\\nthe master issues read time slots. Therefore, the master\\nmust generate read time slots immediately after issuing\\na Read Scratchpad [BEh] or Read Power Supply [B4h]\\ncommand, so that the DS18B20 can provide the requested data. In addition, the master can generate read time\\nslots after issuing Convert T [44h] or Recall E[2] [B8h] commands to find out the status of the operation as explained\\nin the DS18B20 Function Commands section.\\n\\nAll read time slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration\\nwith a minimum of a 1µs recovery time between slots. A\\nread time slot is initiated by the master device pulling the\\n1-Wire bus low for a minimum of 1µs and then releasing\\nthe bus (see Figure 16). After the master initiates the\\n\\n\\nread time slot, the DS18B20 will begin transmitting a 1\\nor 0 on bus. The DS18B20 transmits a 1 by leaving the\\nbus high and transmits a 0 by pulling the bus low. When\\ntransmitting a 0, the DS18B20 will release the bus by the\\nend of the time slot, and the bus will be pulled back to\\nits high idle state by the pullup resister. Output data from\\nthe DS18B20 is valid for 15µs after the falling edge that\\ninitiated the read time slot. Therefore, the master must\\nrelease the bus and then sample the bus state within\\n15µs from the start of the slot.\\n\\nFigure 17 illustrates that the sum of TINIT, TRC, and\\nTSAMPLE must be less than 15µs for a read time slot.\\nFigure 18 shows that system timing margin is maximized\\nby keeping TINIT and TRC as short as possible and by\\nlocating the master sample time during read time slots\\ntowards the end of the 15µs period.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
