      " The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to  12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an  alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper  and lower trigger points. The DS18B20 communicates  over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one  data line (and ground) for communication with a central    microprocessor. In addition, the DS18B20 can derive  power directly from the data line (“parasite power”),    eliminating the need for an external power supply.  Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which  allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire  bus. Thus, it is simple to use one microprocessor to  control many DS18B20s distributed over a large area.  Applications that can benefit from this feature include  HVAC environmental controls, temperature monitoring  systems inside buildings, equipment, or machinery, and  process monitoring and control systems. \n",

      " Figure 3 pin descriptions are given in the  The 64-bit ROM stores the device’s unique serial code.  The scratchpad memory contains the 2-byte temperature  register that stores the digital output from the temperature  sensor. In addition, the scratchpad provides access to the  1-byte upper and lower alarm trigger registers (T T tion register allows the user to set the resolution of the  temperature-to-digital conversion to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits.  The T (EEPROM), so they will retain data when the device is  powered down. The DS18B20 uses Maxim’s exclusive 1-Wire bus proto- col that implements bus communication using one control  signal. The control line requires a weak pullup resistor  since all devices are linked to the bus via a 3-state or  open-drain port (the DQ pin in the case of the DS18B20).  In this bus system, the microprocessor (the master  device) identifies and addresses devices on the bus  using each device’s unique 64-bit code. Because each  device has a unique code, the number of devices that  can be addressed on one bus is virtually unlimited. The  1-Wire bus protocol, including detailed explanations of the  commands and “time slots,” is covered in the  1-Wire Bus  System  section. Another feature of the DS18B20 is the ability to oper- ate without an external power supply. Power is instead  supplied through the 1-Wire pullup resistor through the  DQ pin when the bus is high. The high bus signal also  ), which then supplies  power to the device when the bus is low. This method of  deriving power from the 1-Wire bus is referred to as “para- site power.” As an alternative, the DS18B20 may also be  The core functionality of the DS18B20 is its direct-to- digital temperature sensor. The resolution of the tempera- ture sensor is user-configurable to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits,  corresponding to increments of 0.5°C, 0.25°C, 0.125°C,  and 0.0625°C, respectively. The default resolution at  power-up is 12-bit. The DS18B20 powers up in a low- power idle state. To initiate a temperature measurement  and A-to-D conversion, the master must issue a Convert  T [44h] command. Following the conversion, the resulting  thermal data is stored in the 2-byte temperature register  in the scratchpad memory and the DS18B20 returns to its  idle state. If the DS18B20 is powered by an external sup- ply, the master can issue “read time slots” (see the  1-Wire  Bus System   section) after the Convert T command and  the DS18B20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the tem- perature conversion is in progress and 1 when the con- version is done. If the DS18B20 is powered with parasite  power, this notification technique cannot be used since  the bus must be pulled high by a strong pullup during the  entire temperature conversion. The bus requirements for  parasite power are explained in detail in the  Powering the  DS18B20  section. Figure 3.

This flag is updated after every temperature measure- ment; therefore, if the alarm condition goes away, the flag  will be turned off after the next temperature conversion.  The master device can check the alarm flag status of  all DS18B20s on the bus by issuing an Alarm Search  [ECh] command. Any DS18B20s with a set alarm flag will  respond to the command, so the master can determine  exactly which DS18B20s have experienced an alarm  condition. If an alarm condition exists and the T H  or T L  settings have changed, another temperature conversion  should be done to validate the alarm condition. \n",

      "## Powering the DS18B20 \n",
      "\n",
      " The DS18B20 can be powered by an external supply on  the V DD  pin, or it can operate in “parasite power” mode,  which allows the DS18B20 to function without a local  external supply. Parasite power is very useful for applica- tions that require remote temperature sensing or that are  very space constrained.  Figure 3  shows the DS18B20’s  parasite-power control circuitry, which “steals” power from  the 1-Wire bus via the DQ pin when the bus is high. The  stolen charge powers the DS18B20 while the bus is high,  and some of the charge is stored on the parasite power  capacitor (C PP ) to provide power when the bus is low.  When the DS18B20 is used in parasite power mode, the  V DD  pin must be connected to ground. In parasite power mode, the 1-Wire bus and CPP can pro- vide sufficient current to the DS18B20 for most operations  as long as the specified timing and voltage requirements  are met (see the  DC Electrical Characteristics  and  AC  Electrical Characteristics ). However, when the DS18B20  is performing temperature conversions or copying data  from the scratchpad memory to EEPROM, the operating  current can be as high as 1.5mA. This current can cause  an unacceptable voltage drop across the weak 1-Wire  pullup resistor and is more current than can be supplied  by C . To assure that the DS18B20 has sufficient supply  current, it is necessary to provide a strong pullup on the  1-Wire bus whenever temperature conversions are tak- ing place or data is being copied from the scratchpad to  EEPROM. This can be accomplished by using a MOSFET  to pull the bus directly to the rail as shown in  Figure 6 . The  1-Wire bus must be switched to the strong pullup within  10µs (max) after a Convert T [44h] or Copy Scratchpad  [48h] command is issued, and the bus must be held high  by the pullup for the duration of the conversion (t CONV )  or data transfer (t WR  = 10ms). No other activity can take  place on the 1-Wire bus while the pullup is enabled. The DS18B20 can also be powered by the conventional  method of connecting an external power supply to the  V DD  pin, as shown in  Figure 7 . The advantage of this  method is that the MOSFET pullup is not required, and  the 1-Wire bus is free to carry other traffic during the tem- perature conversion time. The use of parasite power is not recommended for tem- peratures above +100°C since the DS18B20 may not be  able to sustain communications due to the higher leak- age currents that can exist at these temperatures. For  applications in which such temperatures are likely, it is  strongly recommended that the DS18B20 be powered by  an external power supply. In some situations the bus master may not know whether  the DS18B20s on the bus are parasite powered or pow- ered by external supplies. The master needs this informa- tion to determine if the strong bus pullup should be used  during temperature conversions. To get this information,  the master can issue a Skip ROM [CCh] command fol- lowed by a Read Power Supply [B4h] command followed  by a “read time slot”. During the read time slot, parasite  powered DS18B20s will pull the bus low, and externally  powered DS18B20s will let the bus remain high. If the  bus is pulled low, the master knows that it must supply  the strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus during temperature  conversions. Figure 6.

To verify data integrity, the scratchpad  can be read (using the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command)  after the data is written. When reading the scratchpad,  data is transferred over the 1-Wire bus starting with the  least significant bit of byte 0. To transfer the T H , T L  and  configuration data from the scratchpad to EEPROM, the  master must issue the Copy Scratchpad [48h] command.  Data in the EEPROM registers is retained when the  device is powered down; at power-up the EEPROM data  is reloaded into the corresponding scratchpad locations.  Data can also be reloaded from EEPROM to the scratch- pad at any time using the Recall E 2  [B8h] command. The  master can issue read time slots following the Recall E 2   command and the DS18B20 will indicate the status of the  recall by transmitting 0 while the recall is in progress and  1 when the recall is done.

      "\n",
      " CRC bytes are provided as part of the DS18B20’s 64-bit  ROM code and in the 9 th  byte of the scratchpad memory.  The ROM code CRC is calculated from the first 56 bits  of the ROM code and is contained in the most significant  byte of the ROM. The scratchpad CRC is calculated from  the data stored in the scratchpad, and therefore it chang- es when the data in the scratchpad changes. The CRCs  provide the bus master with a method of data validation  when data is read from the DS18B20. To verify that data  has been read correctly, the bus master must re-calculate  the CRC from the received data and then compare this  value to either the ROM code CRC (for ROM reads) or  to the scratchpad CRC (for scratchpad reads). If the cal- culated CRC matches the read CRC, the data has been  received error free. The comparison of CRC values and  the decision to continue with an operation are determined  entirely by the bus master. There is no circuitry inside the  ceeding if the DS18B20 CRC (ROM or scratchpad) does  The equivalent polynomial function of the CRC (ROM or  The bus master can re-calculate the CRC and compare it  to the CRC values from the DS18B20 using the polyno- mial generator shown in  Figure 11 . This circuit consists  of a shift register and XOR gates, and the shift register  bits are initialized to 0. Starting with the least significant  bit of the ROM code or the least significant bit of byte 0  in the scratchpad, one bit at a time should shifted into the  shift register. After shifting in the 56th bit from the ROM or  the most significant bit of byte 7 from the scratchpad, the  polynomial generator will contain the recalculated CRC.  Next, the 8-bit ROM code or scratchpad CRC from the  DS18B20 must be shifted into the circuit. At this point, if  the re-calculated CRC was correct, the shift register will  contain all 0s.

      "## 1-Wire Bus System \n",
      "\n",
      " The 1-Wire bus system uses a single bus master to con- trol one or more slave devices. The DS18B20 is always a  slave. When there is only one slave on the bus, the sys- tem is referred to as a “single-drop” system; the system is  “multidrop” if there are multiple slaves on the bus.  All data and commands are transmitted least significant  bit first over the 1-Wire bus. The following discussion of the 1-Wire bus system is  broken down into three topics: hardware configuration,  transaction sequence, and 1-Wire signaling (signal types  and timing). \n",
      "\n",
      "## Hardware Configuration \n",
      "\n",
      " The 1-Wire bus has by definition only a single data line.  Each device (master or slave) interfaces to the data line  via an open-drain or 3-state port. This allows each device  to “release” the data line when the device is not transmit- ting data so the bus is available for use by another device.  The 1-Wire port of the DS18B20 (the DQ pin) is open  drain with an internal circuit equivalent to that shown in  Figure 12 .  The 1-Wire bus requires an external pullup resistor of  approximately 5kΩ; thus, the idle state for the 1-Wire  bus is high. If for any reason a transaction needs to be  suspended, the bus MUST be left in the idle state if the  transaction is to resume. Infinite recovery time can occur  between bits so long as the 1-Wire bus is in the inactive  (high) state during the recovery period. If the bus is held  low for more than 480µs, all components on the bus will  be reset. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Transaction Sequence \n",
      "\n",
      " The transaction sequence for accessing the DS18B20 is  as follows: Step 1.\t Initialization Step 2.\t ROM Command (followed by any required data  exchange) Step 3.\t DS18B20 Function Command (followed by any  required data exchange) It is very important to follow this sequence every time the  DS18B20 is accessed, as the DS18B20 will not respond  if any steps in the sequence are missing or out of order.  Exceptions to this rule are the Search ROM [F0h] and  Alarm Search [ECh] commands. After issuing either of  these ROM commands, the master must return to Step 1  in the sequence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Initialization \n",
      "\n",
      " All transactions on the 1-Wire bus begin with an initializa- tion sequence. The initialization sequence consists of a  reset pulse transmitted by the bus master followed by  presence pulse(s) transmitted by the slave(s). The pres- ence pulse lets the bus master know that slave devices  (such as the DS18B20) are on the bus and are ready  to operate. Timing for the reset and presence pulses is  detailed in the  1-Wire Signaling  section. \n",
      "\n",
      "## ROM Commands \n",
      "\n",
      " After the bus master has detected a presence pulse, it  can issue a ROM command. These commands operate  on the unique 64-bit ROM codes of each slave device  and allow the master to single out a specific device if  many are present on the 1-Wire bus. These commands  also allow the master to determine how many and what  types of devices are present on the bus or if any device  has experienced an alarm condition. There are five ROM  commands, and each command is 8 bits long. The master  device must issue an appropriate ROM command before  issuing a DS18B20 function command. A flowchart for  operation of the ROM commands is shown in  Figure 13 . \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Search Rom [F0h] \n",
      "\n",
      " When a system is initially powered up, the master must  identify the ROM codes of all slave devices on the bus,  which allows the master to determine the number of  slaves and their device types. The master learns the  ROM codes through a process of elimination that requires  the master to perform a Search ROM cycle (i.e., Search  ROM command followed by data exchange) as many  times as necessary to identify all of the slave devices.

For a detailed explanation of the Search  ROM procedure, refer to  Application Note 937: Book of  iButton ®  Standards .

      "\n",
      "#### Match Rom [55H] \n",
      "\n",
      " The match ROM command followed by a 64-bit ROM  code sequence allows the bus master to address a  specific slave device on a multidrop or single-drop bus.  Only the slave that exactly matches the 64-bit ROM code  sequence will respond to the function command issued  by the master; all other slaves on the bus will wait for a  reset pulse.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Skip Rom [CCh] \n",
      "\n",
      " The master can use this command to address all devices  on the bus simultaneously without sending out any ROM  code information. For example, the master can make all  DS18B20s on the bus perform simultaneous temperature  conversions by issuing a Skip ROM command followed by  a Convert T [44h] command.  Note that the Read Scratchpad [BEh] command can  follow the Skip ROM command only if there is a single  slave device on the bus. In this case, time is saved by  allowing the master to read from the slave without send- ing the device’s 64-bit ROM code. A Skip ROM command  followed by a Read Scratchpad command will cause  a data collision on the bus if there is more than one  slave since multiple devices will attempt to transmit data    simultaneously.  \n",

      "\n",
      " The operation of this command is identical to the operation  of the Search ROM command except that only slaves with  a set alarm flag will respond. This command allows the  master device to determine if any DS18B20s experienced  an alarm condition during the most recent temperature  conversion. After every Alarm Search cycle (i.e., Alarm  Search command followed by data exchange), the bus  master must return to Step 1 (Initialization) in the transac- tion sequence. See the  Operation—Alarm Signaling  sec- tion for an explanation of alarm flag operation. \n",

      " After the bus master has used a ROM command to  address the DS18B20 with which it wishes to communi- cate, the master can issue one of the DS18B20 function  commands. These commands allow the master to write  to and read from the DS18B20’s scratchpad memory,  initiate temperature conversions and determine the power  supply mode. The DS18B20 function commands, which  are described below, are summarized in  Table 3  and illus- trated by the flowchart in  Figure 14 . \n",

If the device is being used in parasite power  mode, within 10µs (max) after this command is issued  the master must enable a strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus  for the duration of the conversion (t CONV ) as described  in the  Powering the DS18B20  section. If the DS18B20 is  powered by an external supply, the master can issue read  time slots after the Convert T command and the DS18B20  will respond by transmitting a 0 while the temperature  conversion is in progress and a 1 when the conversion is  done. In parasite power mode this notification technique  cannot be used since the bus is pulled high by the strong  pullup during the conversion. \n",

Several signal types are  defined by this protocol: reset pulse, presence pulse, write  0, write 1, read 0, and read 1. The bus master initiates all  these signals, with the exception of the presence pulse. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Initialization Procedure—Reset And  Presence Pulses \n",
      "\n",
      " All communication with the DS18B20 begins with an ini- tialization sequence that consists of a reset pulse from the  master followed by a presence pulse from the DS18B20.  This is illustrated in  the presence pulse in response to the reset, it is indicating  to the master that it is on the bus and ready to operate.  During the initialization sequence the bus master trans- mits (T X ) the reset pulse by pulling the 1-Wire bus low  for a minimum of 480µs. The bus master then releases  the bus and goes into receive mode (R X ). When the bus  is released, the 5kΩ pullup resistor pulls the 1-Wire bus  high. When the DS18B20 detects this rising edge, it waits  15µs to 60µs and then transmits a presence pulse by pull- ing the 1-Wire bus low for 60µs to 240µs. The bus master writes data to the DS18B20 during write  time slots and reads data from the DS18B20 during read  time slots. One bit of data is transmitted over the 1-Wire  There are two types of write time slots: “Write 1” time slots  and “Write 0” time slots. The bus master uses a Write 1  time slot to write a logic 1 to the DS18B20 and a Write  0 time slot to write a logic 0 to the DS18B20. All write  time slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration with a  minimum of a 1µs recovery time between individual write  slots. Both types of write time slots are initiated by the  To generate a Write 1 time slot, after pulling the 1-Wire  bus low, the bus master must release the 1-Wire bus  within 15µs. When the bus is released, the 5kΩ pullup  resistor will pull the bus high. To generate a Write 0 time  slot, after pulling the 1-Wire bus low, the bus master must  continue to hold the bus low for the duration of the time  slot (at least 60µs). The DS18B20 samples the 1-Wire bus during a window  that lasts from 15µs to 60µs after the master initiates the  write time slot. If the bus is high during the sampling win- dow, a 1 is written to the DS18B20. If the line is low, a 0  is written to the DS18B20. Figure 15.

      "\n",
      " The DS18B20 can only transmit data to the master when  the master issues read time slots. Therefore, the master  must generate read time slots immediately after issuing  a Read Scratchpad [BEh] or Read Power Supply [B4h]  command, so that the DS18B20 can provide the request- ed data. In addition, the master can generate read time  slots after issuing Convert T [44h] or Recall E mands to find out the status of the operation as explained  in the  All read time slots must be a minimum of 60µs in duration  with a minimum of a 1µs recovery time between slots. A  read time slot is initiated by the master device pulling the  1-Wire bus low for a minimum of 1µs and then releasing  the bus (see  Figure 16 ). After the master initiates the  read time slot, the DS18B20 will begin transmitting a 1  or 0 on bus. The DS18B20 transmits a 1 by leaving the  bus high and transmits a 0 by pulling the bus low. When  transmitting a 0, the DS18B20 will release the bus by the  end of the time slot, and the bus will be pulled back to  its high idle state by the pullup resister. Output data from  the DS18B20 is valid for 15µs after the falling edge that  initiated the read time slot. Therefore, the master must  release the bus and then sample the bus state within  , and  T SAMPLE  must be less than 15µs for a read time slot.  Figure 18  shows that system timing margin is maximized  by keeping T INIT  and T RC  as short as possible and by  locating the master sample time during read time slots  towards the end of the 15µs period.

      "\n",
      " In this example there is only one DS18B20 on the bus and  it is using parasite power. The master writes to the TH, TL,  and configuration registers in the DS18B20 scratchpad  and then reads the scratchpad and recalculates the CRC  to verify the data. The master then copies the scratchpad  contents to EEPROM.  Rx 9 data bytes scratchpad and compares the  calculated CRC with the read  CRC (byte 9). If they match,  the master continues; if not, the  read operation is repeated. the master continues; if not, the  read operation is repeated. Tx Reset Master issues reset pulse. Rx Presence DS18B20 responds with  presence pulse. Tx CCh Master issues Skip ROM  command. Tx 48h Master issues Copy Scratchpad  command.  Tx DQ line  held high by  strong pullup Master applies strong pullup to  DQ for at least 10ms while copy  operation is in progress. \n",
