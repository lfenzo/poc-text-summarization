      "The 64-bit ROM stores the device’s unique serial code.\n",
      "The scratchpad memory contains the 2-byte temperature\n",
      "register that stores the digital output from the temperature\n",
      "sensor. In addition, the scratchpad provides access to the\n",
      "1-byte upper and lower alarm trigger registers (TH and\n",
      "TL) and the 1-byte configuration register. The configuration register allows the user to set the resolution of the\n",
      "temperature-to-digital conversion to 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits.\n",
      "The TH, TL, and configuration registers are nonvolatile\n",
      "(EEPROM), so they will retain data when the device is\n",
      "powered down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 uses Maxim’s exclusive 1-Wire bus protocol that implements bus communication using one control\n",
      "signal. The control line requires a weak pullup resistor\n",
      "since all devices are linked to the bus via a 3-state or\n",
      "open-drain port (the DQ pin in the case of the DS18B20).\n",
      "In this bus system, the microprocessor (the master\n",
      "device) identifies and addresses devices on the bus\n",
      "using each device’s unique 64-bit code. Because each\n",
      "device has a unique code, the number of devices that\n",
      "can be addressed on one bus is virtually unlimited. The\n",

      "commands and “time slots,” is covered in the 1-Wire Bus\n",
      "_System section._\n",

      "corresponding to increments of 0.5°C, 0.25°C, 0.125°C,\n",
      "and 0.0625°C, respectively. The default resolution at\n",
      "power-up is 12-bit. The DS18B20 powers up in a lowpower idle state. To initiate a temperature measurement\n",
      "and A-to-D conversion, the master must issue a Convert\n",
      "T [44h] command. Following the conversion, the resulting\n",
      "thermal data is stored in the 2-byte temperature register\n",
      "in the scratchpad memory and the DS18B20 returns to its\n",
      "idle state. If the DS18B20 is powered by an external supply, the master can issue “read time slots” (see the 1-Wire\n",
      "_Bus System_ section) after the Convert T command and\n",
      "the DS18B20 will respond by transmitting 0 while the temperature conversion is in progress and 1 when the conversion is done. If the DS18B20 is powered with parasite\n",
      "power, this notification technique cannot be used since\n",
