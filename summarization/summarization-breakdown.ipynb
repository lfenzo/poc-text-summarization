      "The DS18B20 is a direct-to-digital temperature sensor that offers user-configurable resolutions of 9, 10, 11, or 12 bits. The default resolution at power-up is 12-bit, which corresponds to increments of 0.0625°C. To initiate a temperature measurement and A-to-D conversion, the master must issue a Convert T command. Following the conversion, the resulting thermal data is stored in the 2-byte temperature register in scratchpad memory. The DS18B20 returns to its idle state after the conversion. If powered by an external supply, the master can use \"read time slots\" to determine when the conversion is done. However, if powered with parasite power, this notification technique cannot be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output temperature data is calibrated in degrees Celsius and stored as a 16-bit signed-extended two's complement number in the temperature register. The sign bits indicate whether the temperature is positive or negative. The DS18B20 can be configured for different resolutions, which affects the validity of the temperature register bits. For example, at 12-bit resolution, all bits are valid; at 9-bit resolution, bits 2, 1, and 0 are undefined.\n",

The sign bit (S) indicates whether the value is positive or negative. If the measured temperature is within the specified range, an alarm condition exists and a flag is set inside the DS18B20. This flag updates after every measurement, and if the alarm condition resolves, the flag turns off. The master device can check the alarm flag status of all DS18B20s on the bus using the Alarm Search [ECh] command. If an alarm condition exists and T or T settings have changed, another temperature conversion is recommended to validate the alarm condition.\n",

      "The DS18B20 digital thermometer can operate in \"parasite power\" mode, which allows it to function without a local external supply, making it useful for remote temperature sensing or space-constrained applications. In parasite power mode, the 1-Wire bus and a capacitor provide sufficient current to the DS18B20, but high currents during temperature conversions can cause an unacceptable voltage drop across the weak 1-Wire pullup resistor. To resolve this issue, a strong pullup on the 1-Wire bus is required, which can be achieved by using a MOSFET to pull the bus directly to the rail. The DS18B20 can also be powered by an external supply connected to the V pin, but parasite power mode should not be used for temperatures above +100°C.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "The DS18B20 is a programmable resolution 1-wire digital thermometer that can be used in various applications. It uses a strict 1-wire communication protocol to ensure data integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Programmable resolution**: The device allows the user to set the resolution of the temperature measurement.\n",
      "* **1-Wire interface**: The device communicates with the host using a single wire, reducing the number of wires required for communication.\n",
      "* **Digital output**: The device provides a digital output of the temperature measurement.\n",
      "* **Low power consumption**: The device consumes low power, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Communication Protocol**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 uses a strict 1-wire communication protocol to ensure data integrity. The protocol defines several signal types:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Reset pulse**: A reset pulse is sent by the host to initiate communication.\n",
      "* **Presence pulse**: The device responds with a presence pulse to indicate its presence on the bus.\n",
      "* **Write time slots**: The host writes data to the device during write time slots.\n",
      "* **Read time slots**: The host reads data from the device during read time slots.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Initialization Procedure**\n",
      "\n",
      "The initialization procedure consists of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reset pulse: The host sends a reset pulse to initiate communication.\n",
      "2. Presence pulse: The device responds with a presence pulse to indicate its presence on the bus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Write Time Slots**\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two types of write time slots:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Write 1**: A logic 1 is written to the device during a Write 1 time slot.\n",
      "* **Write 0**: A logic 0 is written to the device during a Write 0 time slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The host must release the bus within 15µs after pulling it low for a Write 1 time slot. For a Write 0 time slot, the host must continue to hold the bus low for at least 60µs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Read Time Slots**\n",
      "\n",
      "The host reads data from the device during read time slots. The device samples the bus during a window that lasts from 15µs to 60µs after the host initiates the read time slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ROM Commands**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 supports several ROM commands:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Search ROM**: Searches for devices on the bus.\n",
      "* **Read ROM**: Reads the ROM code of a single device on the bus.\n",
      "* **Match ROM**: Matches the ROM code of a specific device on the bus.\n",
      "* **Skip ROM**: Skips the ROM code and addresses all devices on the bus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Function Commands**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 supports several function commands:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Convert T**: Initiates a temperature conversion.\n",
      "* **Write Scratchpad**: Writes data to the scratchpad memory.\n",
      "* **Read Scratchpad**: Reads data from the scratchpad memory.\n",
      "* **Copy Scratchpad**: Copies data from the scratchpad memory to EEPROM.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Power Supply**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 can be powered by an external supply or parasitic power. The device consumes low power, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 is a programmable resolution 1-wire digital thermometer that provides accurate temperature measurements. Its low power consumption and simple communication protocol make it suitable for various applications, including industrial, medical, and consumer electronics.====================================================================================================\n",
      "**Summary of DS18B20 Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer**\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 is a programmable resolution 1-wire digital thermometer that can be used to measure temperature with high accuracy. Here are the key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Read Time Slots**: The master device must generate read time slots immediately after issuing a Read Scratchpad or Read Power Supply command, so that the DS18B20 can provide the requested data.\n",
      "* **Timing Requirements**: All read time slots must be at least 60µs in duration with a minimum of 1µs recovery time between slots. A read time slot is initiated by the master device pulling the 1-wire bus low for a minimum of 1µs and then releasing the bus.\n",
      "* **Data Transmission**: The DS18B20 transmits data on the bus by leaving it high or pulling it low. Output data from the DS18B20 is valid for 15µs after the falling edge that initiated the read time slot.\n",
      "* **System Timing Margin**: The system timing margin is maximized by keeping TINIT and TRC as short as possible and by locating the master sample time during read time slots towards the end of the 15µs period.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Related Application Notes**\n",
      "\n",
      "The following application notes can be applied to the DS18B20:\n",
