      "The DS18B20 digital temperature sensor uses the 1-Wire communication protocol. To write data to the sensor, the master device must generate Write time slots, which are initiated by pulling the 1-Wire bus low and releasing it within a certain timeframe. A Write 0 time slot is created by holding the bus low for at least 60µs, while a Write 1 time slot is generated by releasing the bus high after 15µs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To read data from the sensor, the master device must generate Read time slots, which are initiated by pulling the 1-Wire bus low for at least 1µs and then releasing it. The sensor transmits data on the bus, with a high state indicating a 1 and a low state indicating a 0. Output data is valid for 15µs after the falling edge that initiated the read time slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 can only transmit data when the master device issues Read time slots immediately after a command such as Read Scratchpad or Read Power Supply. All read time slots must be at least 60µs in duration with a minimum of 1µs recovery time between slots.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of system timing, it is essential to keep T, the recovery time between write and read operations, short, and locate the master sample time during read time slots towards the end of the 15µs period. This maximizes system timing margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DS18B20 has various application notes that can be applied to its use, including Understanding and Using Cyclic Redundancy Checks with Maxim iButton Products. Sample 1-Wire subroutines for reading and writing iButtons via serial interfaces are available on the Maxim website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In two operation examples provided, a master device initiates temperature conversions in multiple DS18B20s using parasite power and verifies data by recalculating CRCs. In another example, a single DS18B20 is used with parasite power to write and read scratchpad contents, which are then copied to EEPROM."
